# Olympic Athletes

This repository contains the code and data for the machine learning model that predicts the winner of Olympic games from Athens 1896 to Rio 2016.

## Project Title

Athens 1896 - Rio 2016: A sprint through the years

## Approach

The approach taken for this project is Supervised ML.

## Classes

The classes used in this project are Gold/Silver/Bronze/NoMedal.

## Clean Data and Make Decisions

National Olympic Committees (NOC) were used instead of countries. The year column was removed, but not the city column. 

## PyCaret

PyCaret was used to find the best models, fix imbalance, check feature importance, and manually tune the selected models.

## Visualize Data

Data was visualized to better understand the insights and develop a story, including fun-facts.
